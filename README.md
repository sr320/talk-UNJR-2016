There is an amazing amount of diversity incorporated into the genome of oysters and other marine invertebrates including vastly expanded gene families, high mutation rates, and numerous mobile elements. These are certainly a benefit to broadcast spawners living in fluctuating environments.  Recent work examining DNA methylation is revealing new insight into similar diversity at the epigenetic level. The function of DNA methylation in species such as bivalves where the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in gene bodies is not completely understood. One emerging possible explanation is that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene function, a potential phenomenon that has arisen from selective pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. 
With respect to commericially important traits, we know that in other taxa epigenetic marks are associated with phenotypes independent of genetic structure, the environment can influence DNA metylation, and epigenetic marks can be inherited. In shellfish we are still learning about role of epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation in controlling the phenome, however it appears that epigenetic processes should be considered in the efforts to advance aquaculture.

The Japanese spiny lobster, Panurilus japonicus, is commercially important crustacean in Japan. Since the lobster fishery is fully exploited, development of the seed production and rearing techniques of the lobster has been desired eagerly. However, specific biological characteristics of phyllosoma, such as their peculiar body form, protracted lifespan (about one year), and pelagic open-ocean life, have hindered significant progress in culture.

To overcome these problems and produce large numbers of juveniles through larval culture, the research program, Development of Seed Production Technology in Japanese Spiny Lobster, was started in 2005. The project team consists of two sub-teams, sub-team to improve and develop diets, and sub-team to improve and develop rearing methods of phyllosoma.

In order to improve and develop diets, we are trying to investigate natural diets of lobster phyllosoma by molecular methods. Improvement of dietary value of Artemia and gonad of mussel, which are known to be effective as foods for phyllosoma, and development of artificial feed are in progress. We are also trying to develop methods to evaluate and control conditions of phyllosoma in the rearing tank by monitoring expression of DNA responsible for biodefense, molting, and digestion. The survival rate of phyllosoma has been gradually increasing year by year by incorporating these results into culturing methods.

 

Annotated Bibliography

An annotated bibliography with 3-5 key papers on the topic of your symposium presentation along with your abstract is required prior to the meeting. These annotated bibliographies replace the literature exchange completed during previous UJNR meetings. The goal is to focus the exchange of literature citations on the Science Symposium topic and to allow for experts in the field to highlight key papers from each country to assist their counterparts explore in more detail references specific to individual presentation topics. This will be especially helpful to the U.S. members as much of the literature published in Japanese is difficult for U.S. researchers to access or understand. A combined annotated bibliography of key papers on the Symposium topic comprised of contributions by all presenting scientists will be published with the proceedings.

The annotations for the 3-5 bibliographic references that the author considers key works in the field should provide a brief description of the work, the results and the reasons why the author considers it a key work. Key works should relate to the topic of your presentation and may be your own work or that of other scientists. When possible, key works should be from your own country. An example is given below to aid in formatting. Reprints or links to key papers would be appreciated, but are not required.

Mozaffarian, D. and E. Rimm.  2006.  Fish intake, contaminants, and human health: Evaluating the risks and benefits. JAMA, Vol 296:15.  Pp 1885-1899.

The authors for the first time present a comprehensive human health model based on concentrations of mercury, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls and long chain n-3 fatty acids for fish and project the impact of increased seafood consumption in the United States on the population’s health. This model accounts for the increased risks associated with consumption of contaminated seafood along with the benefits from increased consumption of long chain n-3 fatty acids. Overall the authors predict that increasing the per capita consumption of seafood in the United States from 16 to 26 lbs/person (1-2 servings per week of species high in n-3 fatty acids) would result in a decrease in coronary death by 36% and an overall decrease in total mortality of 17%. Further the authors provide the amounts to consume of various species and the cost to provide the benefits associated with seafood consumption. Implications for target nutrient and contaminate levels in aquacultured fish can be derived from the information presented in this paper.

All material is to be provided in a standardized computer format (Microsoft Word), Times New Roman font and 12 pt font size, and one inch margins. The unedited abstracts and annotated bibliography will be available at the symposium. Please email your abstract and annotated bibliography to Clete Otoshi (NMFS.Aquaculture.Science@noaa.gov) by October 19, 2016 with the subject line "UJNR Submission.”
